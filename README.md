# Underdog Android Take Home Challenge

This is a very basic application written in Kotlin, which loads and displays data from The Sports DB leveraging
common libraries (e.g. Retrofit).

Also provided below is a list of tasks to complete. Some are required, while the rest are completely optional.

## Instructions
- Please spend no more than 2 hours on this assignment.
- Given you are only expected to spend up to 2 hours on this project, we only expect you to complete
  the required tasks and 1-2 optional tasks (depending on the ones you opt to do).
- After completing your tasks within the allotted time, please take a couple minutes to answer the questions in `Thoughts.md`.
- To submit, zip your project and upload to Greenhouse

## Tasks to complete
### Required
(Recommended to complete in order)
1. After a recent change, the app has begun crashing on launch. Identify and fix the crash so the application will launch as expected.
2. The list of Sports Leagues does not scroll. Improve the UX by enabling the page to scroll.
3. Currently, nothing happens when a user clicks an item in the Sports Leagues list. When a user clicks on a league, the user should be able to see a list of the teams within that league below the league title.

### Optional
(These are in no particular order, and it is entirely up to you which task(s) you opt to implement.)
1. Refactor the codebase to leverage an architecture which will scale as the project grows.
2. Implement a cache, assuming list(s) of leagues and teams do not change more often than 1/week on.
3. Introduce Dependency Injection to the codebase.
4. Improve the UI/UX in any way you see fit.
